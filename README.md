# Quichat â€“ zeroâ€‘infra-P2P chat

Quichat is a small Goâ€¯1.24 program that lets you chat over the Internet without a server in the middle. It speaks both TCP and QUICâ€‘v1, finds other peers through the libp2p Kademlia DHT, and slips past most home routers with AutoRelay. Messages travel on libp2pâ€™s GossipSub mesh and carry microâ€‘second timeâ€‘stamps, so you can see real latency in the log.

## Why bother with another chat tool?

* **No central server** â€“ each laptop calls the other directly. If that fails, they borrow a relay for the handshake and keep going.
* **Modern transport** â€“ QUICâ€‘v1 is the same tech under HTTP/3. Faster first handshake, builtâ€‘in multiplexing, and better luck with NATs.
* **Plain terminal UI** â€“ readline gives you history, Ctrlâ€‘R search, and colours without a heavy GUI.
* **One static binary** â€“ `go build` produces a \~7â€¯MB file that runs on any modern Linux, macOS, or Windows box. No config files, no database.

## Quick start

1. **Build**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/you/quichat.git
   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install golang-go 
   # macOS (Homebrew)
   brew install go 
   cd quichat
   go mod tidy
   ```
2. **Start a listener**

   ```bash
   go run . run --listen 4001 --nick alice
   ```
   ***Example Output***

   ```bash
      Your multiaddr: /ip4/10.61.34.169/tcp/4001/p2p/12D3KooWKWzVjFaizQNEYf3cJCDeZbAbXacHVB4haqwakSmQNZHo

        ___ ___ ___    ___  _   _ ___ ___ _  _   _ _____ 
      | _ |_  | _ \  / _ \| | | |_ _/ __| || | /_|_   _|
      |  _// /|  _/ | (_) | |_| || | (__| __ |/ _ \| |  
      |_| /___|_|    \__\_\\___/|___\___|_||_/_/ \_|_|  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

      Welcome to P2P Quichat! ðŸš€
      *** alice joined the chat ***
    ```

  Copy the multiâ€‘address the program prints.

3. **Start a dialer** (new terminal or second machine)

   ```bash
   ./go run --listen 4003 \
                --bootstrap "<multiâ€‘addrâ€‘fromâ€‘Alice>" \
                --nick bob
   ```

   Say hello â€“ you should see the message in both windows.

#### Builtâ€‘in slash commands

| Command | Description                      |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `/list` | List peers currently in the room |
| `/ping` | Roundâ€‘trip latency to each peer  |
| `/help` | Show inâ€‘terminal cheatâ€‘sheet     |
| `/quit` | Graceful leave                   |

## How it works (short version)

* **Kadâ€‘DHT** â€“ every node stores its address in a shared hashâ€‘table. You donâ€™t need to run a tracker.
* **AutoRelay** â€“ if direct UDP fails, the peers fall back to TCP; if that fails too, they talk through a public relay. No portâ€‘forwarding needed.
* **GossipSub** â€“ a selfâ€‘healing broadcast layer; each peer helps spread messages, so the chat stays alive even if some users drop out.
* **QUICâ€‘v1** â€“ one 1â€‘RTT handshake sets up TLSâ€¯1.3, and all chat lines travel in a multiplexed stream. If the remote side doesnâ€™t speak QUIC, we fall back to TCP without fuss.

### Typical flow

1. Alice starts Quichat â†’ announces herself in the DHT.
2. Bob gets Aliceâ€™s address and tries QUIC.
3. If QUIC fails, Bob tries TCP; if that fails, they relay.
4. Once a path is up, every line is encrypted endâ€‘toâ€‘end and forwarded by the mesh.
